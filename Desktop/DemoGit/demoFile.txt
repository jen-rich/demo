I am a 
professional electronic thief that never gets caught. I once stole Watson from IBM.

There's no point in stealing electronics if the electronics don't exist! I burned down IBM, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. etc. Also I burned down your house too.

I fixed this by making a brand new electronics company for her to steal electronics from.
